This project requires the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) both to compile and during runtime.  
Please download a zip distribution from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/, unzip, and place swt.jar
in your dev-lib folder.  For Eclipse users, your classpath is also pre-configured to expect swt.jar in the
dev-lib folder by default.
